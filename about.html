	<p> I was born in Samoa, on May 3rd, 2003. I have 4 siblings, I am the second oldest.
	 I am goofy, nice, and love to sing. I may not be the best singer, but who cares. 
	 There are times where I like to just be alone and have some chill time. 
	 I really love to sleep and love to eat.
	</p>
	 <p> When it comes to food I can eat anything. I love sushi and chicken. 
	 I love to play sports, I am tomboyish, not tomboyish. I love to play volleyball, I was the only freshman to play varsity.
	</p>
	 <p>I have a little brother who is really irritating and there are times when he is cute, but overall I find him very lovable. He has long hair and he is really evil. There was this one time where I had hot chips and he loves hot chips, so he decided to take my bag of chips. And eats the chips without my permission, I was so mad, but I couldn't do anything because of my mom and because he was just too cute when he said,"Charlynn I'm sowwyy."
	 </p>
	 <p> I value family, loyalty, and respect because I really love my family and feel that they are the most important people in my life. I have many people who will support me in everything that I do and they will always correct me in a respectful way, lead me to the right path. I value loyalty because if you are going to strive for something you will need to be loyal to that goal and know that you will committed to that goal. I value respect becacuse if you do not show me respect then I will not show you respect. I will have an attitude that will surely make you regret not being respectful to me.
